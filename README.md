## Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I share problem solutions using Flask-RestAPI.

Here you will find a collection of common Flask-RestAPI problems that have been solved and documented by me. From creating endpoints to data manipulation and authentication, this repository aims to provide clear and efficient solutions to a variety of challenges encountered in API development using Flask.

To get started, make sure you have a virtual environment where all necessary dependencies will be installed:

1. Through the terminal or Vscode, navigate to the directory of your choice and type the following command to create a virtual environment:

```
Windows: python -m venv (environment_name)

Linux: python3 -m venv (environment_name)
```

2. Now you need to activate the virtual environment:

```
Windows: source environment_name/Scripts/activate

Linux: source environment_name/bin/activate
```

With your virtual environment activated, you can now install the dependencies. To do this, simply enter the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will automatically install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that you have all the necessary libraries to run the code examples in this repository. Once the dependencies are installed, you can explore the solved problems and their respective solutions, as well as experiment with and adapt the code to your own needs. I hope this repository proves useful to you in your Flask-RestAPI development!
