# 1Â° Advanced Challenge

1. **Development of a RESTful API for a Blog System:**

   - Create a RESTful API using Flask-RestAPI.
   - The API should allow the following operations:
     - Create new posts.
     - Update existing posts.
     - View posts, including the ability to filter by different criteria such as publication date, author, category, etc.
     - Delete posts.
   - Implement authentication and authorization to control access to API operations.
     - Implement login with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication or another secure method.
     - Protect sensitive routes, such as creating, updating, and deleting posts, by requiring valid tokens.
     - Consider hashing and security strategies for storing user passwords.
   - Utilize good API design practices, such as using appropriate HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) and meaningful URLs.
   - Persist data securely in a database such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, according to preference.

2. **Implementation of Rate Limiting:**

   - Implement rate limiting in your Flask-RestAPI application to mitigate potential brute force attacks or resource abuse.
   - Define reasonable rate limits for each API route, considering your server's capacity and expected usage.
   - Use suitable libraries like Flask-Limiter to simplify the implementation and management of rate limits.
   - Consider fallback strategies or clear error messages to handle requests that exceed rate limits.
   - Test the rate limiting functionality to ensure it is effective and does not hinder legitimate API usage.

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - Utilize a database management system to persist data for the blog system.
   - Choose a database that meets your application's needs and provides adequate security and performance.
   - Efficiently model the database, considering the structure of posts, users, comments, etc.
   - Implement data access logic in your application, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
   - Consider backup and recovery strategies to protect data against loss or corruption.
